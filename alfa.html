    <p class="margin-top30">Well, what does luxurious mean to you? To many art directors it means expensive looking assets (which take a while to load), to some visual designers it means tiny UI (but no one knows how to use those sites).</p>
    <p>To me it meant that this site has to be as good on the phone as it would be on desktop (if not better), has to load fast, and you have to forget that you're building a car. If this app was going to be luxurious, it has to be minimal in presence but maximal in feeling. Feeling of simplicity, intuition, effortlessness...and you can almost feel Alfa Romeo.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The first wire was made on a 320px width Sketch artboard, but it was obvious at the start that a critical decision was deciding how the content would break across viewports.</p>
    <p>I was leading the experience on this project and had a talented team comprised of a UX Designer and Visual Designer who I knew would be up for the ride! We went through every single Build & Price configurator from every OEM. We liked some, we disliked most, and we surprisingly broke a few.</p>
    <p><!-- We did our own research, our own testing, and we didn't quite know the extent of what a user would want if they were in the process of researching or buying a car. I was at the time coincidenally in the market for a vehicle, I spent countless hours on YouTube, researching, learning; visiting a few dealerships (ugh, omg...), meating people selling used cars, test-driving a bunch. It helped with our process a lot. --> We looked at stepped configurators, desktop-based configurators, complicated interactions and A LOT of conflict warnings. What became clear was that in order to keep things simple across breakpoints, the vehicle would need to remain in one spot on the page and the data-fed options and attributes would behave independently, at least visually speaking. The diagram below was a clarity moment when deciding where content would break.</p>

    <figcaption class="centered">Separating data from the visual meant more flexibility across breakpoints.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Everything would have its place with this approach. We've seen configurators with pages upon pages of configurations; single-page configurators that rely only on modals for each category; we wanted something new, something that felt natural.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="quote margin-top30 centered">The most natural interaction you can have online is scrolling.</h4>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This decision came hand in hand with placing all the data within a dedicated column. It made more and more sense. Things began to take shape, we looked at every aspect of the UI and flow with great attention to detail, day after day. In order to progressivly increase the complexity of the app, we build a flow that would look like this:</p>

    <figcaption class="centered">Vehicle selection requires 1 selection &rarr; Trim selection has a few options, a couple primary filters and a comparison chart &rarr; Application has everything. </figcaption>
