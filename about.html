        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant" data-tooltip="Restaurant"></div>Imanishi</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">I went to Imanishi the day after landing back from Tokyo...and, well it felt like I was still in the city. The place has been open for a while now — too many know about it — but still I've had countless memorable nights here. Thanks for the good vibes ~</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>North Of Brooklyn</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Everyone's got their pizza spot, you know, something close by, something that always hits right. This place makes NY—style pizza and is very unpretentious about it. I like to walk around the area for an extra layer of comfy sensations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification nature"></div>The Island</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">No cell reception in some parts and if you're facing south then it feels like you're in a different country. I never understood the haters, cuz the island to me always means a quiet space to relax and enjoy the summer sun. The sound of the waves and the sunsets are always a great mood. It's next level if you bike there.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification nature"></div>Trinity Bellwoods</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">I might sound basic for saying this but the central city park is amazing. Yeah, it gets crowded and yeah people should clean up after themselves more, but if you have 15 mins alone or a few <i>endless</i> hours with friends, it'll gonna be a good time no matter what.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>Sunrise House</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Lots of people have found this gem in Koreatown thanks to its affordable prices and delicious food in large amounts. Big fan of the 반찬 side dishes there.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification place"></div>Poetry</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">When returning from a trip, it's a good idea to reset at a place that always has great live jazz and an atmosphere that sends you elsewhere.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>Ramen Isshin</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">This is the best ramen joint in the city. Thankfully, they've now opened a second location, so it's possible to taste those noods without lining up for an hour. I can't order anything other than the Tan Tan Ramen because it makes me feel all the things. It's pure umami.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>Bahn Mi Boys</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Fried chicken bao. Bao chicken fried. It's worth the wait. They have other stuff, obviously, but still.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>RuRu Baked</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">New hype cream on the block. Will probably need to update this paragraph, but so far haven't had to test my luck with the extremely quick—selling weekly drops; thankful for the friends that come through with the hook-ups!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>Dumpling House</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Not sure why I always think of this place on a Tuesday (they're closed on Tuesdays), but this place has <i>the</i> juiciest dumplings, this side of the ocean. I get fried pork and chive ones and forget everything that's wrong with the world with the first bite.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification place"></div>TIFF</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Gotta be honest, there's not <i>that</i> much art culture in Toronto. Tiff, though it sells fast, gives you a portal into international film perspectives, and I'm grateful for it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>416 Snack Bar</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">I don't go here often but when I do I go off. Korean Fried Chicken + cocktails through the night.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification place"></div>Swipe</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">When work gets annoying, Swipe's collection of design books calms me down. It's located on the lower floor of 401 Richmond, so if you decide to wander through the building you'll likely find a small exhibition that'll distract you from the grind.</p>

        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification book" data-tooltip="Restaurant"></div>The Terracotta Dog</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">The first Andrea Camilleri novel I read, though second in the series, is the one that punched me then most because I didn't see it coming. Camilleri wields words like a sushi master, elegantly written poetry with swift directness and comforting softness, laced in an umami wrap of sass, humour and sadness.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification music"></div>Tyler, The Creator</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">The thick buzzy drone that opens IGOR connected me to years growing up on electronic music, feeling connected to all the digital sounds only for it to be flipped into fuzzy crackling sample-sounding hip hop funk that sounds like it's coming from your room. Flower Boy is one of my favourite albums cuz of its wavy vibes and clever voices, so when IGOR started playing, shit went off, in the best way possible. A wonderful male voice for this generation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification book"></div>A Cook's Tour</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Anthony Bourdain has got to be the most humble American that's lived. I've also never seen or read anyone speak about mental collapse in such an exciting way. It's an unbelievaby sad art to be this hyper aware of moments, surroundings and other people's energy. What makes it heatbreakingly lovely though, is hearing Bourdain's voice in your head with each sentence that you read.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification object"></div>Breath of the Wild</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">I might have to write a whole page on this, though for now, I think the effect of Ocarina of Time was so strong that god forbids anything came close. Well, BOTW came close and went past it. There's so much thought put into every minute aspect of this game that only makes me want to move to Japan even more. What I mean by that is that it takes a certain kind of personal characteristic to want to devote such an immense amount of energy on the absurd. It's the absurd that makes art seem realistic. You see it in Miyazaki's movies, and this time you see it in a Zelda game. GTA5 has a massive map, but this one felt like a world. Climate, flora, fauna, topography, physics, the never-tiring story-through-gameplay, I couldn't believe it. It's unbelievable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification fooddrink"></div>Corn Kakiage</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">It's the crispiest sweetness, a dish that kicks off the night at Imanishi, a dish that might end it, too. Thinking about it makes me wonder if there's seriously a better savoury bite on the face of this planet. It's better than a soft-boiled egg covered in flaky salt, it's better than steak done to your liking dipped in chimichurri. Woof. I said what I said.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification film"></div>I n t e r s t e l l a r</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Hathaway's acting is as bad as it always is; the story is as American and colonial as you can find one. So, the idea, the execution, the effects have to be so good to compete with that. Maybe there aren't enough movies about time dilation — there are definitely not enough movies about light bending sound warping reality distorting black holes. Amazing visual feat. Also, McConaughey's got great delivery.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>Vichy's Après Soleil</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">I'm obviously not talking about any burns that are described in degrees, but I've had a number that are almost a Keynote presentations on how consistently hopeful I am in the face of the sun's power. I've finally become more careful, and I'm definitely not saying that I'm a lobster but I have to be honest and admit that I'm not as impervious as I would like to believe I am. More sunscreen from now on and a continued awareness of time spent in the shade. All that to say that the Après Soleil has gotten me out of a pickle a few times. You might think it's silly to write a paragraph about this product, and you may well be right, but I still chose to write it. So, take it as you will. This product is like jumping in a comfy, lightly scented, semi-dry but yet very creamy bath of relief.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification fooddrink"></div>Amaro</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Only on my website would I have the freedom to talk endlessly about things that don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things. Amari are amazing drinks, which will most probably always take care of you. I'm glad I found them. If you enjoy having drinks as bitter as life itself you'll understand the kind of upsetting but also satisfying feeling it is to drink them. Side note, amaro means bitter in Italian, so it's what it says on the tin. The tasty sweetness is all within the steady control of the bitterness which varies depending on the brand. It helps me not feel dizzy the following morning, which is one of the functions of a digestif. Nonino is top notch, Aperol on the patios, Campari when you're serious, Averna and Lucano when you're in Milan (or pretending). Tasty on its own, slippery when mixed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification restaurant"></div>iPhone 8</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">It's seen a dangerous amount of things. Fallen and been broken countless times. Holds my music offline so I can play Black Panther on repeat fifty times if I need to. It uses the same form factor as the previous number of generations but I don't care, I don't want to let go of the Home button and I don't want to have parts of the screen obstructed by poorly advertised feature benefits. The iPhone 8 is the best phone that I've ever had. iOS 11 — yup, I still use 11 — tries not to be buggy (and it fails sometimes) but it also keeps up with the fast context switching and data manipulation that I've come to expect even if I'm upside down (it's a figure of speech (or is it)). It was a good move to max out the storage and definitely a good camera that performs when you need it to. I can launch a rocket with this thing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification fooddrink"></div>Pizza</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">Pizza is desert of the savoury world. It's the best thing that you'll put in your mouth and you'll want to eat it every day without every getting tired of it. We're still talking about pizza. It's sweet and salty, briny and crispy, crunchy and gooey, sour and bitter. It's the most versatile surface other than maybe the dumpling. It's a vibe no matter what, it's the best food invention, still.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text30 margin-top50">
        <h3 class="serif"><div class="classification book"></div>Notes from Underground</h3>
        <p class="thin margin-top5">It's sickening and visceral. All too familiar roller coaster of feelings. Dostoevsky writes the uncomfortable but also the most poetic truth you'll find printed on paper. This book is an analysis on life, whether you like it or not.</p>

      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>First of all, there's no perfect process. The best thing that I can recommend is to be willing to adapt to all kinds of scenarios, for projects big or small, to be curious and open, to listen and to tell the truth. There will be unexpected events and you better be able to think quickly on your feet and get your hands dirty!</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Requirements Gathering</h3>
      <p>This crutial part of the project can sometimes be taken care of by client services or project managers if that's how your team operates. That kind of facilitation helps tremendously but as a designer (of all kinds) don't think you'll be designing just yet. During that kick-off meeting, it's your job to ask questions, pay attention to details and be able gather a comprehensive list of requirements so that you don't have to guess later on.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Research</h3>
      <p>This was always a personal favourite &mdash; might be the introverted side speaking. Research is your chance to explore and go as far and wide to pick up as many references and contradictions on each topic. If you have a team, you can also schedule opportunities for team discussions while conducting heuristic analises and competitive comparisons. Solo tasks can include looking at analytics if they're available, and if they're not ask for them!</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Ideation</h3>
      <p>Once you've equipped yourself with a decent amount of knowledge and a point to prove, it's time to start ideating, alone or in a group. Hand sketches, whiteboards and workshops are perfect for this. It can be nerve-wracking for some but it's good to step outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes, the best way to get the point across is with a few fast drawings on a board, where somehow you can feel parts of the website coming together. Be expressive but to the point, critique ideas and concepts but be willing to receive critiques too. It's nothing personal...it really never is, it's a website or an app, the point is to come up with the best solution possible. Whether it's a creative director or a junior designer, if the solution is good that's what matters.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Rapid Prototyping</h3>
      <p>Whether it's just one person on the team that puts together a prototype or a few people, everyone should try to convey the point in the best way that they can. One major aspect of this is being honest with your own skills and choosing how you will approach a prototype and which tool you will use. Now's not the time to learn Principal if you don't know how to use it (unless you're willing to work late). The point is to pick what you're good at because that way you can focus on the idea and not on the software. (I tend to pick HTML/CSS because it's the tool that comes the most naturally to me, but sometimes all you need is a few slides in XD and the job is done.)</p>
      <p>You can test your prototypes and ideas online, in person, with a large group or with 5 people. It's really important to try to do that. It can be as simple as walking over to a few people to get their thoughts. You'll find that people are honest when they see a new app or design and it will help you a lot! It can help pick directions, it can help create stronger hypotheses, either way find a way to test your ideas.</p>
      <p>There can be a few of these, depending on the complexity of a project, you might have to loop through <b>Research</b>, <b>Ideation</b>, and <b>Rapid Prototyping</b> a number of times for a number of sections of the project.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Organization</h3>
      <p>A large number of projects that I work on tend to deal with some form of dynamic data. It's the added layer of complexity that for better or worst I have to work with so if your project/team/agency doesn't deal with this sort of stuff you can consider talking about it with your developers to see if it would simplify things in the long run.</p>
      <p>If you have the privilege to work with dynamic feeds, you find out quickly that as a UX designer you have to wrap your head around not only the problem but all the intricacies behind the scenes (especially in the context of a modular component-based framework). You might find flaws in the data and if that happens you have to talk about it and come up with a way to address it. (More on that on the <a class="paragraph_link" href="alfa.html">Alfa Romeo</a> project page). A product can have dozens or hundreds of attributes that create "infinite" amount of permutations, so sometimes it's good to fire up the old spreadsheet software and get cracking with tabular data. Trust me, organizing it so that you can find anomalies, so that you can make sense of things, so that sometimes you can show the client just how complex things can be, is 100% worth the extra effort.</p>
      <p>When you wrap your head around this, another thing you need to wrap your head around (which may or may not be informed by the spreadsheet you've just created) is an experience or journey map. Again, it depends on the scale of the project, but outlining experience touchpoints is critical in building a sound solution. People don't just experience one side of the product in one place. Thinking wider and planning for for every interaction will lead to better solutions and better product satisfaction.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Experience Strategy</h3>
      <p>Some of these can happen before or after another (or simultaneously) so this order shouldn't be set in stone. For experience strategy (by now you've gathered insights, explored and tested ideas, and organized data, so you should have a decent idea what you're going to build), you want to bring your focus on each section of the product or website, one at a time. It helps to zoom into a specific area and zoom out, so that you can start to establish rhythms in the experience. You can create highly interactive moments that are surrounded by greater amounts of space or imagery, then go back into interactions and specifics. A solid experience strategy is one that takes the user's needs into account while organizing the content in a way that will keep them engaged and focused on learning.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Creative</h3>
      <p>With a strong experience strategy and plan in place you can give more structure to visual designers that can then take things further. Go off and explore all kinds of interaction paradigms, create artboard after artboard (and some of this might happend earlier on or might be used as reference from previous steps in the process), trying things even if "they don't work" at first. In my experience, a pair of visual designer and ux designer can work on these in tandem. The importance is place on the fact that both disciplines need to be respectful of one another. It obviously takes time to build strong collaborations and friendships, that's why it's important to cultivate that frame of mind and way of working as it leads to greater results. Ultimately, the visual designer has the responsibility to make it work and look great. It's a lot of weight to carry so as a UX designer in this pair, learn how to help in whatever ways you can!</p>
      <p>After a bunch of this, it's important to narrow down scope and pick the best ideas and solutions that are created. This for the sake of time but also there always needs to be movement &mdash; if you're stuck on a problem, switch things up, don't be afraid to focus on something else, then come back to it later. But inevitably, we all need to pick the best direction and move forward.</p>
      <p>There can be another round of prototyping if necessary, this can be as simple as microinteractions or as large and page flows.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Documentation</h3>
      <p>Depending on the relationship with front and back-end developers, whether they sit next to you or across the world, you'll need to choose the best way to document the designs so that they are understood by the people that need to build it. Sometimes that way is defined before you join a job and you have to learn that process, other times you have the chance to define it yourself. In the end, <i>it doesn't matter what tool you use</i> as long as it's clear how it works, functions, behaves, etc. You can make a prototype and record a video of it, you can link to an already existing piece of code, you can spend hours on Confluence, putting together the most detailed wiki, as long as it facilitates transition from design to development.</p>

      <h3 class="margin-top50">Openness</h3>
      <p>This isn't really a step, more of an attitude that I think helps everyone involved. Be ready to speak to different people, to hear the different concerns across disciplines, to change and adapt on the fly. Be curious but also trust your skills. And please, leave your ego at the door, because your ego will not build a solution, collective hard work will!</p>
