    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>20 years ago I started coding, 14 years ago I started designing, 8 years ago I started building experiences.</p>
      <p class="margin-top50">I enjoy literature, studying transportation and movement, speech and languages, quantum mechanics, and cooking. From 9&mdash;5 I design systems and from 5&mdash;9 I enjoy trying new things. Approach me with your thoughts on typography, food, or the smell of campfire and we might talk through the night.</p>

      <h2 class="centered notbold">Design Process</h2>
      <p class="margin-top50">First of all, there's no perfect process. The best thing that I can recommend is to be willing to adapt to all kinds of scenarios, for projects big or small, to be curious and open, to listen and to tell the truth. There will be unexpected events and you better be able to think quickly on your feet and get your hands dirty!</p>

      <h5>Requirements Gathering</h5>
      <p>This crutial part of the project can sometimes be taken care of by client services or project managers if that's how your team operates. That kind of facilitation helps tremendously but as a designer (of all kinds) don't think you'll be designing just yet. During that kick-off meeting, it's your job to ask questions, pay attention to details and be able gather a comprehensive list of requirements so that you don't have to guess later on.</p>

      <h5>Research</h5>
      <p>This was always a personal favourite &mdash; might be the introverted side speaking. Research is your chance to explore and go as far and wide to pick up as many references and contradictions on each topic. If you have a team, you can also schedule opportunities for team discussions while conducting heuristic analises and competitive comparisons. Solo tasks can include looking at analytics if they're available, and if they're not ask for them!</p>

      <h5>Ideation</h5>
      <p>Once you've equipped yourself with a decent amount of knowledge and a point to prove, it's time to start ideating, alone or in a group. Hand sketches, whiteboards and workshops are perfect for this. It can be nerve-wracking for some but it's good to step outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes, the best way to get the point across is with a few fast drawings on a board, where somehow you can feel parts of the website coming together. Be expressive but to the point, critique ideas and concepts but be willing to receive critiques too. It's nothing personal...it really never is, it's a website or an app, the point is to come up with the best solution possible. Whether it's a creative director or a junior designer, if the solution is good that's what matters.</p>

      <h5>Rapid Prototyping</h5>
      <p>Whether it's just one person on the team that puts together a prototype or a few people, everyone should try to convey the point in the best way that they can. One major aspect of this is being honest with your own skills and choosing how you will approach a prototype and which tool you will use. Now's not the time to learn Principal if you don't know how to use it (unless you're willing to work late). The point is to pick what you're good at because that way you can focus on the idea and not on the software. (I tend to pick HTML/CSS because it's the tool that comes the most naturally to me, but sometimes all you need is a few slides in XD and the job is done.)</p>
      <p>You can test your prototypes and ideas online, in person, with a large group or with 5 people. It's really important to try to do that. It can be as simple as walking over to a few people to get their thoughts. You'll find that people are honest when they see a new app or design and it will help you a lot! It can help pick directions, it can help create stronger hypotheses, either way find a way to test your ideas.</p>
      <p>There can be a few of these, depending on the complexity of a project, you might have to loop through <b>Research</b>, <b>Ideation</b>, and <b>Rapid Prototyping</b> a number of times for a number of sections of the project.</p>

      <h5>Organization</h5>
      <p>A large number of projects that I work on tend to deal with some form of dynamic data. It's the added layer of complexity that for better or worst I have to work with so if your project/team/agency doesn't deal with this sort of stuff you can consider talking about it with your developers to see if it would simplify things in the long run.</p>
      <p>If you have the privilege to work with dynamic feeds, you find out quickly that as a UX designer you have to wrap your head around not only the problem but all the intricacies behind the scenes (especially in the context of a modular component-based framework). You might find flaws in the data and if that happens you have to talk about it and come up with a way to address it. (More on that on the <a class="paragraph_link" href="alfa.html">Alfa Romeo</a> project page). A product can have dozens or hundreds of attributes that create "infinite" amount of permutations, so sometimes it's good to fire up the old spreadsheet software and get cracking with tabular data. Trust me, organizing it so that you can find anomalies, so that you can make sense of things, so that sometimes you can show the client just how complex things can be, is 100% worth the extra effort.</p>
      <p>When you wrap your head around this, another thing you need to wrap your head around (which may or may not be informed by the spreadsheet you've just created) is an experience or journey map. Again, it depends on the scale of the project, but outlining experience touchpoints is critical in building a sound solution. People don't just experience one side of the product in one place. Thinking wider and planning for for every interaction will lead to better solutions and better product satisfaction.</p>

      <h5>Experience Strategy</h5>
      <p>Some of these can happen before or after another (or simultaneously) so this order shouldn't be set in stone. For experience strategy (by now you've gathered insights, explored and tested ideas, and organized data, so you should have a decent idea what you're going to build), you want to bring your focus on each section of the product or website, one at a time. It helps to zoom into a specific area and zoom out, so that you can start to establish rhythms in the experience. You can create highly interactive moments that are surrounded by greater amounts of space or imagery, then go back into interactions and specifics. A solid experience strategy is one that takes the user's needs into account while organizing the content in a way that will keep them engaged and focused on learning.</p>

      <h5>Creative</h5>
      <p>With a strong experience strategy and plan in place you can give more structure to visual designers that can then take things further. Go off and explore all kinds of interaction paradigms, create artboard after artboard (and some of this might happend earlier on or might be used as reference from previous steps in the process), trying things even if "they don't work" at first. In my experience, a pair of visual designer and ux designer can work on these in tandem. The importance is place on the fact that both disciplines need to be respectful of one another. It obviously takes time to build strong collaborations and friendships, that's why it's important to cultivate that frame of mind and way of working as it leads to greater results. Ultimately, the visual designer has the responsibility to make it work and look great. It's a lot of weight to carry so as a UX designer in this pair, learn how to help in whatever ways you can!</p>
      <p>After a bunch of this, it's important to narrow down scope and pick the best ideas and solutions that are created. This for the sake of time but also there always needs to be movement &mdash; if you're stuck on a problem, switch things up, don't be afraid to focus on something else, then come back to it later. But inevitably, we all need to pick the best direction and move forward.</p>
      <p>There can be another round of prototyping if necessary, this can be as simple as microinteractions or as large and page flows.</p>

      <h5>Documentation</h5>
      <p>Depending on the relationship with front and back-end developers, whether they sit next to you or across the world, you'll need to choose the best way to document the designs so that they are understood by the people that need to build it. Sometimes that way is defined before you join a job and you have to learn that process, other times you have the chance to define it yourself. In the end, <i>it doesn't matter what tool you use</i> as long as it's clear how it works, functions, behaves, etc. You can make a prototype and record a video of it, you can link to an already existing piece of code, you can spend hours on Confluence, putting together the most detailed wiki, as long as it facilitates transition from design to development.</p>

      <h5>Openness</h5>
      <p>This isn't really a step, more of an attitude that I think helps everyone involved. Be ready to speak to different people, to hear the different concerns across disciplines, to change and adapt on the fly. Be curious but also trust your skills. And please, leave your ego at the door, because your ego will not build a solution, the hard working team of people will!</p>
